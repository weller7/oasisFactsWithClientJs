# Oasis Facts
Get facts about the band Oasis.

**Link to project:** http://oasisfacts.cyclic.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I used javascript to create an api that gives the user random facts about the band and then I created the front end app that makes the request to the server and gives the user a fact when they click the button. 

## Optimizations
Adding more facts to the API and be able to load other types of media such as images or videos.

## Lessons Learned:
Creating API's and designing the front end that interacts with the data and display it in a user friendly way.
